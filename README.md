I describe myself as the product hacker responsible for growth. Although I am originally a **psychologist** and candidate **organizational behavior specialist** from Hacettepe University; I take a role of **project manager & product manager & product owner** according to the project/product management approach in different organizational climates, at different sociocultural levels and in different sectors.
  
I am confident in **project management, product management, diversity management, technical requirements, refinement, user experience, business intelligence, competitive intelligence, relational coordination, end-to-end software development lifecycle (SDLC), product prototyping, user segmentation, tech & non-tech testing, design & product management tools and UML components.** I can write effective SQL and JQL queries.
  
I am most skilled in *Product Management* and *Brew Coffee*.
